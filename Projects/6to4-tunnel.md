# 4to6 tunnel

4to6 tunneling is a technique that facilitates the creation of a virtual network using IPv4 over the internet via IPv6. This method can be utilized to access the free internet beyond the Great Firewall (GFW), functioning similarly to a Trojan by making connections difficult for firewalls to detect.

[My project](https://github.com/meshya/4to6-tunnel) is a script designed to simplify the process of creating 4to6 tunnels.
