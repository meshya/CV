# CSharp


## Solutions

I'm going to list my complicated solutions in csharp programming. It will reveal frontier of my knowledge about csharp. you will find frontier between things I know and I don't know in csharp, if you're better than me in csharp and pay attention to this solutions


### Create instance using type of a class

![create instance](</pics/create_instance.png>)

In this case we need to a structure for making external modules for a service, the service needs to make multiple instance of that modules, then we make a system which stores the type of that modules ( each module is a class which inherited from BaseDataGenerator class ) then makes instance using Activator module in csharp.

### Logger module using events

I was making a module for a service in Behpouyan *[SII] then I recognized, main service needs to read and save log of module I was making, then I made a new module for this problem

##### Constructor of a module which uses logger ðŸ‘‡

##### Logging ðŸ‘‡

## Libraries

This is a list of libraries and modules I had used in csharp

### EPPlus: write a excel file

![excel in csharp](</pics/excel_csharp.png>)

This is a simple insert data to excel file using EPPlus Package [SII]

### System.Xml

I would work with xml files in csharp, this is a example [SII]
